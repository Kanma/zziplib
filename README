Submodules
----------

This distribution use zlib as a GIT submodule. To download it, do:

If your project already contains another zlib instance, you can tell zziplib to use it
instead. For that, don't download the submodule, and set the CMake variable
ZZIPLIB_ZLIB_PATH.


Compilation

It is recommended to compile the library in a separate folder. Here's how I do it:

	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ cmake ..
	$ make
